On mobile similar but swipe them side to side
Feeds are either videos or articles

Summarise video transcript from youtube to make a description and a non clickbait title
Show video thumbnail in list

Articles get summarised description, and title maybe? Show images for the article too
Ai based rejection list for article feeds, if you like a websites articles but not certain subjects you can block them

Categorise and tag

Import and export opml

Offline reading

Navigate articles with wasd, as you move down the article selected comes to the top and previous one goes to bottom of list, cyclically
